# clojure-koans
This repo logs my solutions for the popular Clojure Koans series and serves as a way to mark my progress as I learn the basics of Clojure.

There are comments in this repo that are marked with this convention: ```;; J - ```. These are simply notes and reminders that I have written to myself.
